# Queens_Gambit
A repository aimed to discuss various games and automate the strategies. Thie repository is principally focussed on the development of basic chess engines varying on the different heuristic functions submitted by the mentees. 
## Getting started
Clone this repository and make all the desired changes and additions. The repository will be periodically updated, and the mentees need to fetch the changes as and when required.
### Week 1
Read the documents in p2_games directory and write a short report on each document (very short). The resources for learning will be attached in the resources directory. Completing the exercise in python_exercise is recommended to get started with the basics of python.

### Week 2
Read the reference provided in order to get a flavour of basic game theory, like concepts of equilibrium. We will refrain from diving into equilibrium simply because it is not very relevant to sequential based games. Basic algorithms and their descriptions have also been provided. The task at hand is to understand how a computer will finally do this, this will be your first exposure to the conventional methods used by computers. What I strongly encourage is to first finish the method and then perhaps try to add your own heuristics which make the performance of your engine better. Best heuristic or atleast some original thought from your side will get a prize!!
