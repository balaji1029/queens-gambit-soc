# Greedy or not

## Introduction

There is a list of n numbers and two players who move alternately. On each move, a player removes either the first or last number from the list, and their score increases by that number and that number gets deleted. Both players try to maximize their scores and play optimally. A certain player wins if their score is strictly greater than the score of the other person.

## My trials

I used recursion in the first try and just the loops in the second try. I used a dictionary to store data to save recalculations. But, the code doesn'e seem so fast. I'm sad ðŸ˜ž...

Most of my time (not much honestly) was wasted by usinf `if n - length % 2 == 0` instead of `if (n - length) % 2 == 0`.

Sooo, yeahhhh

I'll try to work on it later, but for now, I'm gonna go onto the next problems

Until then...
